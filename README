# Color Palette Generator

The Color Palette Generator is a front-end project built using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically generates a palette of colors when the user clicks a button and displays the corresponding HEX color codes on each color box.

## Features

- Generates multiple random colors on button click
- Dynamically creates color boxes using JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Displays HEX color code on each color box
- Automatically adjusts text color (black or white) based on background color brightness for better readability
- Clean and responsive user interface

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)

## How It Works

- Clicking the **Generate** button triggers a JavaScript function
- Random HEX color values are generated
- Color boxes are created dynamically using the DOM
- Each box is filled with a random color
- The HEX code of the color is displayed inside the box
- Text color switches between black or white based on the brightness of the background color

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser

## Learning Objectives

This project helps practice:

- JavaScript functions
- DOM creation and manipulation
- Event handling
- Conditional logic
- Working with color values and brightness calculation

## Future Improvements

- Copy HEX code on click
- Lock individual colors
- Export palette functionality
