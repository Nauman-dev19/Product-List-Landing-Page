# Product List Landing Page

This project is a simple product listing application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically renders a list of products on the page using JavaScript arrays and objects, demonstrating core DOM manipulation and data handling concepts.

## Features

- Displays a list of products dynamically on button click
- Uses JavaScript arrays and objects to manage product data
- Renders product information using DOM methods
- Clean and simple card-based layout
- Beginner-friendly and well-structured code

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)

## How It Works

- Product data is stored in an array of objects in JavaScript
- Each product contains an id, name, price, and category
- Clicking the **Show Products** button triggers a function
- The function dynamically creates and displays product cards on the page

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser

## Learning Objectives

This project helps in practicing:

- Working with arrays and objects
- Using `forEach` for rendering data
- DOM creation and manipulation
- Event handling
- Structuring JavaScript logic cleanly
